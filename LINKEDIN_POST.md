# LinkedIn Post - UK ↔ US Spelling Switch for Figma

---

## Version 1: Problem-First Approach

**Favourite** or **Favorite**?
**Colour** or **Color**?
**Organise** or **Organize**?

If you've ever spent hours manually fixing spelling variations across 150+ design screens for different markets, this will hurt. 😤

Last week, I watched a designer spend **11 HOURS** converting a contact center dashboard from UK to US English.

Finding every "behaviour" → "behavior"
Replacing every "analyse" → "analyze"
Hunting down every "optimisation" → "optimization"

150 screens. 11 hours. Tedious. Error-prone. Soul-crushing.

So I built something.

**UK ↔ US Spelling Switch** - a Figma plugin that does this in 5 minutes. ⚡

Here's what it does:
✅ Scans your entire page in seconds
✅ Finds all 449 spelling variations automatically
✅ Converts everything with ONE click
✅ Preserves case, fonts, and formatting
✅ 100% offline, blazing fast

**Real impact:**
🚀 SaaS launch (150 screens): 11 hours → 5 minutes (97% faster)
👨‍💻 Dev handoff (30 screens): 2.5 hours → 5 minutes (95% faster)
📊 Client deck (40 slides): 50 minutes → 3 minutes (95% faster)

That's **2.5-6 weeks of productive time saved annually** for designers working on international products.

No more:
❌ Ctrl+F nightmares
❌ Missed words
❌ Inconsistent copy
❌ Last-minute handoff delays

Just:
✅ Scan
✅ Review
✅ Replace
✅ Ship

Built with 449 word pairs covering SaaS, AI, Contact Centers, Coaching, Analytics, and business terminology.

**Free. Open source. Available now.**

P.S. If you've ever had to convert "internationalisation" to "internationalization" 47 times across a design system, you'll appreciate this. 😅

## Version 2: Stat-Heavy Hook

**11 hours.**

That's how long it took a designer to manually convert spelling across 150 screens from UK to US English.

In 2024. 🤯

Every international product team faces this:
• Adapting dashboards for US/UK markets
• Localizing features before dev handoff
• Converting client decks for regional pitches
• Updating design systems for global teams

The manual process? Painful:
→ Open each screen
→ Find + Replace hundreds of times
→ Review for missed words
→ Fix broken formatting
→ Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

**There's a better way.**

I just shipped a Figma plugin that automates this entire workflow:

**UK ↔ US Spelling Switch**

One click. 5 minutes. 449 words. Done. ✨

**Time saved (real scenarios):**
📊 Dashboard adaptation: 11h → 5min (97% ↓)
🚀 Feature localization: 2.5h → 5min (95% ↓)
📁 Design system docs: 5.5h → 4min (98% ↓)
🎯 Client presentation: 50min → 3min (95% ↓)

**Annual impact per designer:**
2.5-6 weeks of productive time regained. 🎁

The plugin:
✅ Scans your entire page instantly
✅ Shows exactly what will change
✅ Converts with perfect case preservation
✅ Handles fonts automatically
✅ Works offline, no data collection

**449 word pairs** including:
• Business: monetize, prioritize, customize
• AI/ML: generalize, normalize, visualize
• Contact Centers: analyze, categorize, standardize
• Plus: colour/color, favourite/favorite, centre/center, etc.

**Free. Open source. Ready to use.**

If you design for international audiences, this will save you hours every week.

## Version 3: Story-Driven

**"Can you make this UK version by Friday?"**

It was Tuesday. I had 150 screens. My teammate looked stressed.

Converting our contact center dashboard from US to UK English meant:
• Finding every "behavior" and changing to "behaviour"
• Hunting "analyze" → "analyse"
• Replacing "optimization" → "optimisation"

Across. Every. Single. Screen.

I estimated **8-12 hours of mind-numbing find-replace work.**

As a designer, I didn't want to spend my week being a human spell-checker.

So I built a tool instead. 🛠️

**UK ↔ US Spelling Switch** - a Figma plugin that does in 5 minutes what takes hours manually.

**How it works:**
1️⃣ Click "Scan Page"
2️⃣ See all spelling differences
3️⃣ Click "Replace All"
4️⃣ Done.

**What it handles:**
✅ 449 word pairs (colour/color, organise/organize, etc.)
✅ Perfect case preservation (COLOUR → COLOR, Colour → Color)
✅ Automatic font loading
✅ Batch processing for large files
✅ 100% offline

**Real world impact:**

**Before plugin:**
😫 11 hours for product launch adaptation
😫 2.5 hours before every dev handoff
😫 50 minutes per client presentation
😫 Constant anxiety about missed words

**After plugin:**
😊 5 minutes total
😊 Confidence in consistency
😊 Focus on actual design work
😊 Clean handoffs every time

**Weekly savings:** 2-5 hours per designer
**Annual savings:** 2.5-6 WEEKS of productive time

That 150-screen project? **Done in 10 minutes.** ⚡

My teammate shipped on Thursday. Early.

If you work on international products, SaaS platforms, or global design systems - this will change your workflow.

**Free. Open source. Built for designers.**

## Version 4: Data-Driven Viral Format

97% of designers waste time on spelling conversions.

I'm fixing it.

**The Problem:**

Designers working on international products spend **2-5 hours WEEKLY** on manual spelling conversions.

That's:
→ 8-20 hours monthly
→ 96-240 hours annually
→ **2.5-6 WEEKS of productive time LOST**

All because "colour" vs "color" 🤦‍♂️

**The Solution:**

Just launched: **UK ↔ US Spelling Switch for Figma**

• 100+ component library: 5.5h → 4min (98% faster)
• 40-slide deck: 50min → 3min (95% faster)

**How it works:**
1. Scan (10 seconds)
2. Review (30 seconds)
3. Replace (5 seconds)
4. Ship (instantly)

## Version 5: Controversy Hook (Spicy 🌶️)

**Unpopular opinion:**

Designers shouldn't waste 240 hours/year being human spell-checkers.

Yet here we are.

**The reality:**
Every time you adapt a design for US/UK markets, you:
• Open 100+ screens
• Hit Ctrl+F 500+ times
• Manually verify each change
• Pray you didn't miss anything
• Spend 4-12 hours

For what? Changing "colour" to "color"? 😑

**This is not design work.**

This is administrative hell that:
❌ Doesn't improve the product
❌ Doesn't require creative thinking
❌ Doesn't add user value
❌ Could be automated

So I automated it. 🤖

**UK ↔ US Spelling Switch - Figma Plugin**

**What it replaces:**
→ 11 hours of manual work
→ Spreadsheets of spelling variations
→ Post-it notes with find-replace combos
→ "Did I get all the 'behaviours'?" anxiety
→ Last-minute design QA

**What you get instead:**
✅ 5-minute automated conversion
✅ 449 word pairs built-in
✅ Perfect case preservation
✅ Zero human error
✅ Actually time to design

**Real savings:**
📊 Dashboard launch: 97% faster
🚀 Feature handoff: 95% faster
📁 Design system: 98% faster
🎯 Client deck: 95% faster

**Annual impact:**
**2.5-6 weeks back in your calendar** 📅

**Hot take:**
If you're spending more time on spelling conversions than user research, your workflow is broken.

**Hotter take:**
Your company pays you to design, not to be Microsoft Word.

**Hottest take:**
This should have existed years ago.

Now it does. Free. Open source. No excuses.
